General Munitions Co. specializes in surplus ammunition and armaments, sold to whoever is buying. Be it Miniknog rebels, insurgents, smaller PMC's, or anyone else looking to acquire ordnance in bulk. Their military-industrial complex spans across a large portion of this arm of the galaxy, and the GMC has no shortage of willing buyers.

Find a General Munitions Co. Military Base, a GMC Supply Ship, or acquire a GMC merchant as a tenant in your colony to find Heavy Metal Plates and Wood Varnish, essential crafting components for most GMC products.

Craft a Stamping Press at an Inventor's Table; Here you will be able to craft most GMC products after learning their blueprints, which may be purchased from GMC Suppliers or looted in their military bases. 

Craft a Barracks Workbench at an Inventor's Table to get your hands on some military-grade furniture as well!
