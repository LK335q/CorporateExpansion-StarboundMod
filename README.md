# Corporate Expansion: General Munitions Co.

This mod adds the galactic arms dealing corporation known as GENERAL MUNITIONS CO.

A former private military company, General Munitions Co. specializes in surplus ammunition and armaments, sold to whoever is buying. Be it Miniknog rebels, insurgents, smaller PMC's, or anyone else looking to acquire ordnance in bulk.

Find and speak to a GMC Armorer in one of their many military bases located throughout the galaxy to purchase one of the 50+ weapons included in their arsenal! Or if you aren't much of a gun nut and are more of the builder type, speak to a GMC Supplier to purchase crafting supplies and make military-grade furniture at a Barracks Workbench!

SUPPORTED MODS
