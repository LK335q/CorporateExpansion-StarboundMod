"ORGANIZATIONS SCRAMBLE TO ORION ARM; MEGACORPORATE TITAN NEXUS ANNOUNCES MIGRATION

Amidst the fall of the Terrene Protectorate, groups across the galaxy are migrating in an attempt to fill the power vacuum left behind.",

"Various organizations have recruited refugees, expanding their influence to a great degree.

General Munitions Co. has significantly amped up its firearms production and is now offering their surplus arms to civilian buyers.",

"Nexus Corporation's board of directors has recently announced plans for a migration of over 80% of Nexus's corporate assets to the Orion Arm.

Dozens of satellite corporations are expected to follow suit; Among them, Armax Securities and Echelon are most noteworthy.",

"The only two large enough to have corporate militaries of their own, Armax and Echelon are expected to mobilize much sooner than Nexus to begin claiming territory for themselves.

This kind of migration is unheard of. Though it will be slow, the arrival of such a monolithic corporation will stir this arm of the galaxy.",

"To put it shortly, the possibility of an armed conflict between Nexus and its soon-to-be competitors is very real.

To investors, business owners, politicians, civilians, all alike - we advise taking caution moving forward."
