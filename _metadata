Be it Miniknog rebels, insurgents, smaller PMC's, or anyone else looking to acquire ordnance in bulk.\n\nFind and speak to a GMC Armorer in one of their military bases located throughout the galaxy to purchase some of the 50+ weapons included in their arsenal! Or if you aren't much of a gun nut and are more of the builder type, speak to a GMC Supplier to purchase crafting supplies and make military-grade furniture at a Barracks Workbench!\n\n[h1]ADDONS[/h1]\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2816950097]Corporate Expansion Addon: More Planet Info Patch[/url]\n\n[h1]SUPPORTED MODS[/h1]\nCorporate Expansion has built-in support for these mods, no patch required!\n\n- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2422986190]Futara's Dragon Pixel Full Bright Shader[/url] - Dyes and more will use fullbright if you have this mod installed.
